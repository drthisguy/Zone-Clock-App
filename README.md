## General info
This is the latest rebuild of my personal, developer profile. The goal here was completely redo the existing profile with react components using create-react-app.Essentially, all the HTML and CSS design from the original has been persevered.  Although a little bootstrapy, It look pretty good overall. Additionally, for the first time, the emailer form on the contact page is functional with this, now being a full stack application.
